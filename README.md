# Jons-Rubiks-Cube-Timer
This is my Rubik's cube timer Idea. After using planty of timers, I've decided that I wanted to make something that generates algorithms, stores times accurately, can graph your progress, and allows you to practice algorithms in an efficient way using those same graphs.

To run the program, make sure you go to the "Jons-Rubiks-Cube_Timer" Folder from the repo, and run ./build_and_run.sh in the terminal. App currently only works on mac and linux, not on windows.
