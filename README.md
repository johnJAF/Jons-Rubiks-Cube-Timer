# Jons-Rubiks-Cube-Timer
This is my Rubik's cube timer Idea. After using planty of timers, I've decided that I wanted to make something that generates algorithms, stores times accurately, can graph your progress, and allows you to practice algorithms in an efficient way using those same graphs.

To run the program, make sure you go to the "Jons-Rubiks-Cube-Timer" Folder from the repo, and run ./build_and_run.sh in the terminal. App currently only works on mac and linux, not on windows.

# How Do I use this app?
So when you open up the build_and_run file, you are presented with a home screen. You can press any button and you are sent to the main menu.

In the main menu, you can choose between scrambler, data visualizer (not working yet), algorithm practice, and timer (not working yet. 

# Scrambler

When you open the scrambler, you are presented with a scramble and an option to press any button. These scrambles are 20 long, equally random, and competition legal. 

# Data Visualizer

Not in production

# Algorithm Practice

In algorithm practice there are four different sub-options

Oll
-
Though this is not written yet, the plan is to navigate through OLL categories, display the sub-algorithm with its photo, then show you how to get there from a solved state.
Once you've gotten there from a solved state and you continue, this will start a timer. Your times for each oll algorithm will be saved into its respective file, this creates data for all of your solves. If you messed up a solve, you can take it back by hitting "delete" (mac) or "backspace" (normal) on your keyboard.
